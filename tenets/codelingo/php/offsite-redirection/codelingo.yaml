      Ensures that any redirect with a value that depends directly on value from an http request is validated for offsite redirection.

      Some assumptions are made about the codebase that can be altered according to your project's specific needs:
        - Controllers have an redirect() method
        - HTTP handlers on controllers take symfony request arguments called $request
        - There is a function called offsiteCheck() that checks whether urls point to another site
    flows:
      codelingo/review:
        comments: This redirect url depends on user input and should be validated with offsiteCheck().
