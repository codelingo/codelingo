          "Usually empty try-catch is a bad idea because you are silently swallowing an error condition and then continuing execution. Occasionally this may be the right thing to do, but often it's a sign that a developer saw an exception, didn't know what to do about it, and so used an empty catch to silence the problem." - https://github.com/phpmd/phpmd/blob/master/src/site/rst/rules/index.rst#clean-code-rules
