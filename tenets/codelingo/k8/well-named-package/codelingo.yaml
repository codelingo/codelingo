        title: Well Named Package
        body: |
          Consider parent directory name when choosing a package name. Unless there's a good reason, the `package foo` line should match the name of the directory in which the .go file exists.
      codelingo/review:
        comment: Package name does not match the name of the parent directory. Unless there\'s a good reason, `package {{packageName}}` should match the name of the directory in which {{fileName}} file exists, i.e. {{dirName}}.
