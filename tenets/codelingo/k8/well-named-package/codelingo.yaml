        body: |
          Consider parent directory name when choosing a package name. Unless there's a good reason, the `package foo` line should match the name of the directory in which the .go file exists.

        comment: Package name does not match the name of the parent directory. Unless there\'s a good reason, `package {{packagename}}` should match the name of the directory in which {{filename}} file exists, i.e. {{dirname}}.
