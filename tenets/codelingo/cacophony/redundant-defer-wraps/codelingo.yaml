        title: Redundant Defer Wraps
        body: |
          Finds redundant defer wrapping that could be simplified into a single line.

          A single line defer is cleaner and easier to read than one wrapped in a function.

        comment: Redundant defer wrapping. This can be a single line defer instead, eg. defer log.Println("done").
