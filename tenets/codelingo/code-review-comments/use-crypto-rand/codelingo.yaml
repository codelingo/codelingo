        title: Use Crypto Rand
        body: |
          Do not use package math/rand to generate keys, even 
          throwaway ones. Unseeded, the generator is completely predictable. 
          Seeded with time.Nanoseconds(), there are just a few bits of entropy. 
          Instead, use crypto/rand's Reader, and if you need text, print to 
          hexadecimal or base64
