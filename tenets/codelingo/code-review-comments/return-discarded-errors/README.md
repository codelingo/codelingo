# return-discarded-errors

return-discarded-errors finds errors that are discarded in functions and rewrites them so that they are returned instead. It is different from [do-not-discard-errors](https://github.com/codelingo/codelingo/blob/master/tenets/codelingo/code-review-comments/do-not-discard-errors/codelingo.yaml) which also checks the top level scope and does not rewrite.
