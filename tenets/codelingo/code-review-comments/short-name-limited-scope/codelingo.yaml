        comment: Local variable "{{varName}}" with a limited scope (less than 10 lines) should be short rather than long [as specified in Code Review Comments](https://github.com/codelingo/codelingo/blob/master/tenets/codelingo/code-review-comments/FULL_TEXT.md#variable-names)

        title: Short Name Limited Scope
        body: |    
          Variable names in Go should be short rather than long. This is especially true for local variables with limited scope.
