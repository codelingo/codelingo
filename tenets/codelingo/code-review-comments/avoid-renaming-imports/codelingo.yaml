        title: Avoid Renaming Imports
        body: |
          Avoid renaming imports except to avoid a name collision; good package names
          should not require renaming. In the event of collision, prefer to rename the
          most local or project-specific import.

        comment: |
          This import is renamed to `{{importName}}` but this is a bad practice. 
          Import without specifying a new name.
