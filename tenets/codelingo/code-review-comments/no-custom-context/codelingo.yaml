        comment: Don't create custom Context types or use interfaces other than Context in function signatures. From [Code Review Comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments#contexts)
      codelingo/docs:
        title: No Custom Context
        body: |
          Values of the context.Context type carry security credentials, tracing information, deadlines, and cancellation signals across API and process boundaries. Go programs pass Contexts explicitly along the entire function call chain from incoming RPCs and HTTP requests to outgoing requests.

          Most functions that use a Context should accept it as their first parameter:

          func F(ctx context.Context, /* other arguments */) {}
          A function that is never request-specific may use context.Background(), but err on the side of passing a Context even if you think you don't need to. The default case is to pass a Context; only use context.Background() directly if you have a good reason why the alternative is a mistake.

          Don't add a Context member to a struct type; instead add a ctx parameter to each method on that type that needs to pass it along. The one exception is for methods whose signature must match an interface in the standard library or in a third party library.

          Don't create custom Context types or use interfaces other than Context in function signatures.

          If you have application data to pass around, put it in a parameter, in the receiver, in globals, or, if it truly belongs there, in a Context value.

          Contexts are immutable, so it's fine to pass the same ctx to multiple calls that share the same deadline, cancellation signal, credentials, parent trace, etc.
