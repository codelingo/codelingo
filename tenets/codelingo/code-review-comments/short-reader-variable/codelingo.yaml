        comment: reader variable "{{varName}}" should be a single letter "r", or two letters starting with "r" followed by a number for more readability [See Code Review Comments](https://github.com/codelingo/codelingo/blob/master/tenets/codelingo/code-review-comments/FULL_TEXT.md#variable-names)
        # We currently accept two letters rather than a single letter to allow use of r1...rn. This helps readibility if two readers are needed in the same scope

          Variable names in Go should be short rather than long. This is especially true for local variables with limited scope. Prefer c to lineCount. Prefer i to sliceIndex.

          The basic rule. the further from its declaration that a name is used, the more descriptive the name must be. For a method receiver, one or two letters is sufficient. Common variables such as loop indices and readers can be a single letter (i, r). More unusual things and global variables need more descriptive names.
