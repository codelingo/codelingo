# do-not-discard-errors

do-not-discard-errors finds and comments on discarded errors. It is different from [return-discarded-errors](https://github.com/codelingo/codelingo/blob/master/tenets/codelingo/code-review-comments/return-discarded-errors/codelingo.yaml) which rewrites and only checks inside functions.
