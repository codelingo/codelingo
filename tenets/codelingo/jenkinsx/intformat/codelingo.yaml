tenets:
  # Tenets that ensure integration tests have the correct package name, file name,
  # and custom build directive as per https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/blob/master/docs/contributing/hacking.md#integration-tests.

  # There is a test file for each possible combination of having the directive (D),
  # correct package name (P), and correct filename (F). Every combination except
  # DPF and OOO will be matched by two tenets. For example, DOO will be matched by
  # right-build-directive-wrong-file and right-build-directive-wrong-package,
  #  and OPF will be matched by right-package-wrong-build-directive and 
  # right-file-wrong-build-directive.
  # This gives a total of 12 issues.

  # Caveat: we don't test that the test package name is `<pkgname>_test`, we just test
  # that it ends in `_test`. Similarly we don't test that the test file name is
  # `<pkgname>_integration_test.go`, we just test that it ends in `integration_test.go`.

  # There is an explicit tenet for each case. See more concise possible solutions below.
