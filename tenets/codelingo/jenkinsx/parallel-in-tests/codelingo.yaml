        title: Is Parallel In Tests
        body: |
          Unit tests should contain the `t.Parallel()` directive in order to keep things nice and speedy.

          https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/blob/master/docs/contributing/hacking.md#unit-tests
      codelingo/review:
        comment: This unit test does not contain the `t.Parallel()` directive. Consider adding `t.Parallel()` as the first line of this test to keep it nice and speedy.
