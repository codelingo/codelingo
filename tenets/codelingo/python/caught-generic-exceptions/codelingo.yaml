        title: Caught Generic Exceptions
        body: |
          Find caught generic exceptions.

          In most cases, only specific exceptions should be caught. This allows different exceptions to be handled in different ways.
          Catching generically will capture all other exception types lower in the hierarchy.
          See the full hierarchy of the built in exceptions here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#exception-hierarchy.

          Caught exception is too generic. Catch a more specific exception(s): https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#exception-hierarchy.
