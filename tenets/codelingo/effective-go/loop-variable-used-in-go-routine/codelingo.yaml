            The loop variable is reused for each iteration, so it is shared across all goroutines. We need to make sure that it is unique for each goroutine. One way to do that, is passing the loop variable as an argument to the closure in the goroutine.
            Note: This tenet assumes that loop variables are not shadowed inside goroutine. We need ssa to work to find the right loop variables in that case.
