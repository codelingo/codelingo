        title: Avoid Annotations in Comments
        body: |
          Comments do not need extra formatting such as banners of stars. The generated output
          may not even be presented in a fixed-width font, so don't depend on spacing for alignmentâ€”godoc, 
          like gofmt, takes care of that. The comments are uninterpreted plain text, so HTML and other 
          annotations such as _this_ will reproduce verbatim and should not be used. One adjustment godoc 
          does do is to display indented text in a fixed-width font, suitable for program snippets. 
          The package comment for the fmt package uses this to good effect.
