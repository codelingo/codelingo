        title: Defer Close File
        body: |
          Deferring a call to a function such as Close has two advantages. First, it guarantees that you will never forget to close the file, a mistake that's easy to make if you later edit the function to add a new return path. Second, it means that the close sits near the open, which is much clearer than placing it at the end of the function.
          TODO if a function returns the open file, follow it and check if it is closed
      codelingo/review:
        comment: Add `defer {{fileName}}.Close()` after opening the file `{{fileName}}`. . [as specified in Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#defer)
