        title: no Get at the start of Getters name
        body: |
          It's neither idiomatic nor necessary to put Get into the getter's name. If you have a field called owner (lower case, unexported), the getter method should be called Owner (upper case, exported), not GetOwner.

        comment: Do not use Get at the start of "{{methodName}}", use "{{fixName(varName)}}" instead [as specified in Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#Getters)
