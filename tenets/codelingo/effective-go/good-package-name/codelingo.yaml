        title: Good Package Name
        body: |
          It's helpful if everyone using the package can use the same name 
          to refer to its contents, which implies that the package name should 
          be good: short, concise, evocative. By convention, packages are 
          given lower case, single-word names; there should be no need for 
          underscores or mixedCaps. Err on the side of brevity, since everyone 
          using your package will be typing that name. And don't worry about 
          collisions a priori. The package name is only the default name for 
          imports; it need not be unique across all source code, and in the 
          rare case of a collision the importing package can choose a different 
          name to use locally. In any case, confusion is rare because the file 
          name in the import determines just which package is being used.
