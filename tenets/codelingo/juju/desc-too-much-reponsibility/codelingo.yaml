          Do one thing, do it well. If some exported unit is described as doing "X
          and Y", or "X or Y", it's failing SRP unless its *sole purpose* is the
          concatenation of, or choice between, X and Y.

        comment: This unit is desicribed as doing multiple things. Do one thing and do it well.
