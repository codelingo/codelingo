        title: Type Not Responsible for Dependencies
        body: |
                * DI *doesn't* mean you pass factories around -- making a type
                  repsonsible for *creating* all its dependencies (as well as
                  *using* them) violates SRP.
                    * DI infrastructure code probably will use some factories, this
                      is not the same thing, leaking them unnecessarily is bad
