    #     body: |
    #       bool arguments to functions are often dubious things, as they hint to code that essentially reads like:
          
    #       func doSomething(shouldDoX bool) {
    #         if shouldDoX {
    #           doX()
    #         } else {
    #           doY()
    #         }
    #       }

    #       This is not always the case. However, in cases where that is a fair assessment of the situation, consider 
    #       whether the doSomething function should exist at all.
    #       In cases where the bool in question, along with other arguments, acts as a "knob" to the function consider 
    #       replacing it with some type of "configuration" struct (for examples, see Dave Cheney's treatment of the topic). 
    #       In situations where there's a single bool param or the situation is less clear-cut, consider replacing the 
    #       bool in question with an enum.
