        title: Mixed Marshalling
        body: |
          Find cases where a server marshals data into a client data type.

          Separates client and server versions of a request by ensuring the server never unmarshalls to the client's version. Use the types of your own structs to create a project specific review.
      codelingo/review:
        comment: Request should not be marshalled to a client type in the server.
