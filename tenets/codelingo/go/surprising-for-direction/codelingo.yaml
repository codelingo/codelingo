      title: Surprising for direction
      body: |
        A loop which counts upwards should check an upper bound; a loop which counts downwards
        should check a lower bound. Violating this rule is not necessarily incorrect, but it's
        invariably surprising and likely to confuse readers.

        The loop's exit condition is not consistent with its step operation.
