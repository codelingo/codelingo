        title: Reallocated Slice
        body: Find slices that may be subject to reallocation pointer changes. Designed to catch problems like this https://github.com/juju/juju/commit/8ff9d72ebc07c0f1d2f048e5d0486335e637b313
      codelingo/review:
        comment: This pointer may become invalid as the slice it comes from is reallocated.
