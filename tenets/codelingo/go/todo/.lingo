      Find comments containing TODO.

      TODOs should be tracked in a place outside of the code to ensure they aren't forgotten.
    flows:
      codelingo/review:
        comments: Make sure you add this TODO as an issue, milestone, or in your project management tool; eg. Trello.
    query: |
      import (
        codelingo/ast/go
      )

      @ review.comment
      go.comment({depth: any}):
        text: /(?i)(^|\s)TODO.*/
