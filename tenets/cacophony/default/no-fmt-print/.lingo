      Find uses fmt.Print* (eg. Print, Println, Printf).

      The log package is better suited for logging than the fmt package for a number of reasons:
      1. log can be configured to use different writers.
      2. log messages can include additional info; eg. timestamps, source code location.
      3. log messages will never be interleaved.

          Use log.Print* instead. The log package is better suited for logging.
