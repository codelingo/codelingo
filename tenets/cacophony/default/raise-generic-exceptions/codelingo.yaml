      Find raised generic exceptions.

      Raised exceptions should be as specific as possible to describe the issue as each type can be caught and handled differently.
      Raising generic exceptions requires them to be caught, which will also catch all other exception types lower in the hierarchy.
      See the full hierarchy of the built in exceptions here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#exception-hierarchy.

          Exception type is too generic. Use a more specific exception: https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#exception-hierarchy.
