CodeLingo learns your coding rules to auto identify issues and teach your best practices; keeping you nimble on a fast-moving codebase.

## Installation

### GitHub

To have CodeLingo automatically review every new Pull Request to your repo, [install CodeLingo on your repo](https://github.com/marketplace/codelingo) and add some rules to your repo via the [dashboard](https://dash.codelingo.io).

Every pull request to your repository will now be checked against the rules you've created and published:
